    "# Portmantout Words\n",
    "\n",
    "A [***portmanteau***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) is a word that squishes together two words, like  *math* + *athlete* = *mathlete*.  Inspired by [**Darius Bacon**](http://wry.me/), I covered this as a programming exercise in my 2012 [**Udacity course**](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212). In 2018 I was re-inspired by [**Tom Murphy VII**](http://tom7.org/), who added a new twist:  [***portmantout words***](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/portmantout/) (*tout* from the French for *all*), which are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **portmantout** of a set of words $W$ is a string $S$ such that:\n",
    "* Every word in $W$ is a **substring** of $S$.\n",
    "* The words **overlap**: every word (except the first) starts at an index that is equal to or before the end of another word.\n",
    "* **Nothing else** is in $S$: every letter in $S$ comes from the overlapping words. (But a word may be repeated any number of times.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not part of the definition, the goal is to get as short an $S$ as possible, and to do it for a set of about 100,000 words. Developing a program to do that is the goal of this notebook.  My program (also available as [`portman.py`](portman.py)) helped me discover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **preferendumdums**: a political commentary portmanteau of {prefer, referendum, dumdums}\n",
    "- **fortyphonshore**: a dire weather report portmanteau of {forty, typhons, onshore}; \n",
    "- **allegestionstage**: a brutal  theatre critic portmanteau of {alleges, egestions, onstage}. \n",
    "- **skymanipulablearsplittingler**: a nerve-damaging aviator portmanteau of {skyman, manipulable, blears, earsplitting, tinglers}\n",
    "- **edinburgherselflesslylyricize**: a Scottish music review portmanteau of {edinburgh, burghers, herself, selflessly, slyly, lyricize}\n",
    "- **impromptutankhamenability**: a portmanteau of {impromptu, tutankhamen, amenability}, indicating a willingness to see the Egyptian exhibit on the spur of the moment.\n",
    "- **dashikimonogrammarianarchy**: a portmanteau of {dashiki, kimono, monogram, grammarian, anarchy}, describing the chaos that ensues when a linguist gets involved in choosing how to enscribe African/Japanese garb. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem-Solving Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I haven't proved it, my intuition is that finding a shortest $S$ is an NP-hard problem, and with 100,000 words to cover, it is unlikely that I can find an optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. A common approach to NP-hard problems is a **greedy algorithm**: make the locally best choice at each step, in the hope that the steps will fit together into a solution that is not too far from the globally best solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, my approach will be to build up a **path**, starting with one word, and then adding **steps**  to the end of the evolving path, one at a time. Each step consists of a word from *W* that overlaps the end of the previous word by at least one letter. I will choose the step that seems to be the best choice at the time (the one with the **lowest cost**), and will never undo a step, even if the path seems to get stuck later on. I distinguish two types of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unused word step**: using a word for the first time. (Once we use them all, we're done.)\n",
    "- **Bridging word step**: if no remaining unused word overlaps the previous word, we need to do something to get back on track to consuming unused words. I call that something a **bridge**: a step that **repeats** a previously-used word and has a word ending that matches the start of some unused word. Repeating a word may add letters to the final length of $S$, and it doesn't get us closer to the requirement of using all the words, but it is sometimes necessary. Sometimes two words are required to build a bridge, but never more than two (at least with the 100,000 word set we will be dealing with). \n",
    "\n",
    "There's actually a third type of word, but it doesn't need a corresponding type of step: a **subword** is a word that is a substring of another word. If, say, `ajar` is in $W$, then we know we have to place it in some step along the path. But if `jar` is also in $W$, we don't need a step for it&mdash;whenever we place `ajar`, we have automatically placed `jar`. The program can save computation time save time by initializing the set of **unused words** to be the **nonsubwords** in $W$.  (We are still free to use a subword as a **bridging word** if needed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(*English trivia:* I use the clumsy term \"nonsubwords\" rather than \"superwords\", because there are a small number of words, like \"cozy\" and \"pugs\" and \"july,\" that are not subwords of any other words but are also not superwords: they have no subwords.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're going to be **greedy**, we need to know what we're being greedy about. I will always choose a step that minimizes the **number of excess letters** that the step adds. To be precise: I arbitrarily assume a baseline model in which all the words are concatenated with no repeated words and no overlap between them. (That's not a valid solution, but it is useful as a benchmark.) So if I add an unused word, and overlap it with the previous word by three letters, that is an excess of -3 (a negative excess is a positive thing): I've saved three letters over just concatenating the unused word. For a bridging word, the excess is the number of letters that do not overlap either the previous word or the next word. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** In each row of the table below, `'ajar'` is the previous word,  but each row makes different assumptions about what unused words remain, and thus we get different choices for the step to take. The table shows the overlapping letters between the previous word and the step, and in the case of bridges, it shows the next unused word that the step is bridging to. In the final two columns we give the excess score and excess letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Previous|Step(s)|Overlap|Bridge to|Type of Step|Excess|Letters|\n",
    "|--------|----|----|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| ajar|jarring|jar||unused word |-3| |\n",
    "| ajar|arbitrary|ar||unused word |-2||\n",
    "| ajar|argot|ar|goths|one-step bridge |0||\n",
    "| ajar|arrow|ar|owlets| one-step bridge|1|r|\n",
    "| ajar|rani+iraq|r|quizzed| two-step bridge|5 |anira | \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over the example steps one at a time:\n",
    "- **jarring**: Here we assume `jarring` is an unused word, and it overlaps by 3 letters, giving it an excess cost of -3, which is the best possible (an overlap of 4 would mean `ajar` is a subword, and we already agreed to eliminate subwords).\n",
    "- **arbitrary**: an unused word that overlaps by 2 letters, so it would only be chosen if there were no unused words with 3-letter overlap.\n",
    "- **argot**: From here on down, we assume there are no unused words that overlap, which means that `argot` is a best-possible bridge, because it completely overlaps the `ar` in `ajar` and the `got` in an unused word, `goths`.\n",
    "- **arrow**: overlaps the `ar` in `ajar` and the `ow` in an unused word, `owlets`, but that leaves one excess letter, `r`, for an excess cost of 1.\n",
    "- **rani + iraq**: Suppose `quizzed` is the only remaining unused word. There is no single word that bridges from any suffix of `ajar` to any prefix of `quizzed`. But I have arranged to build two-word bridges for every combination of one letter on the left and one letter on the right (unless there was already a shorter one-word bridge for that combination). The bridge from `'r'` to `'q'` is  `rani` followed by `iraq`, which has an excess score of 5 due to the letters `anira` not overlapping anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that unused word steps always have a negative excess cost (that's good) while bridge steps always have a zero or positive excess cost; thus an unused word step is always better than a bridge step (according to this metric).\n",

    "# Data Type Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I describe how to implement the main data types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word**: a Python `str` (as are subparts of words, like suffixes or individual letters).\n",
    "- **Wordset**: a subclass of `set`, denoting a set of words.\n",
    "- **Path**: a Python `list` of steps.\n",
    "- **Step**: a tuple of `(overlap, word)`. The step adding `jarring` to `ajar` would be `(3, 'jarring')`, indicating an overlap of three letters. The first step in a path should have an overlap of 0; all others should have a positive integer overlap.\n",
    "- **Bridge**: a tuple of an excess cost followed by one or two steps, e.g. `(1, (2, 'arrow'))`.\n",
    "- **Bridges**: a precomputed and cached table mapping a prefixes and suffix to a bridge. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "      W.bridges['ar']['ow'] == (1, (2, 'arrow'))\n",
    "      W.bridges['r']['q']  == (5, (1, 'rani'), (1, 'iraq'))\n",
    "\n",
    "(*Python trivia:* I implemented `Wordset` as a subclass of `set` so that I can add attributes like `W.bridges`. You can do that with a user-defined subclass, but not with a builtin class.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, data tyes are **Capitalized** and indexes into tuples are **UPPERCASE**."

    "# Overall Program Design\n",
    "\n",
    "I  thought I would define a major function, `portman`, to generate the portmantout string $S$ from the set of words $W$ according to the strategy outlined above, and a minor function, `is_portman`, to verify the result. But I found verification to be difficult. For example, given  $S =$  `'...helloworld...'` I would reject that as non-overlapping if I parsed it as `'hello'` + `'world'`, but I would accept it if parsed as `'hell'` + `'low'` + `'world'`. It was hard for `is_portman` to decide which parse was intended, which is a shame because `portman` *knew* which was intended, but  discarded the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I decided to change the interface: I'll have one function that takes $W$ as input and returns  a path $P$, and a second function to generate the string $S$ from $P$.  I decided on the following calling and [naming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman) conventions:\n",

    "As stated above, the approach is to start with one word (either given as an optional argument to `natalie` or chosen arbitrarily from the word set $W$), and then repeatedly add steps, each step being either an unused word or a bridging word. In order to make this process efficient, we arrange for `precompute(W)` to cache the following information in `W`:\n",
    "  - `W.subwords`: a set of all the words that are contained within another word in `W`.\n",
    "  - `W.bridges`: a dict where `W.bridges[suf][pre]` gives the best bridge between the two word affixes.\n",
    "  - `W.unused`: initially the set of nonsubwords in `W`; when a word is used it is removed from the set.\n",
    "  - `W.startswith`: a dict that maps from a prefix to all the unused words that start with the prefix. A word is removed from all the places it appears when it is used. Example: `W.startswith['somet'] == {'something', 'sometimes'}`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "These structures are somewhat complicated, so don't be discouraged if you have to go over a line of code or a prose description word-by-word several times before you understand exactly how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the precomputation, `natalie` loops until there are no more unused words. On each turn we call `unused_step`, which returns a list of one step if an unused word overlaps, or the empty list if it doesn't, in which case we call `bridging_steps`, which always returns a bridge of either one or two steps. We then append the step(s) to the path `P`, and call `used(W, word)` to mark that `word` has been used (reducing the size of `W.unused` and updating `W.startswith` if `word` was previously unused). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that every bridge leads to an unused word. That way we know the program will **always terminate**: if  $N$ is the number of unused nonsubwords in $W$, then consider the quantity $(2N + (1$ `if` the last step overlaps an unused word `else` $0))$. Every iteration of the `while` loop decreases this quantity by at least 1; therefore the quantity will eventually be zero, and when it is zero, it must be that `W.unused` is empty and the loop terminates."

    "# Comparison to Tom Murphy's Program\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare my [program](portman.py) to [Murphy's](https://sourceforge.net/p/tom7misc/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/portmantout/): I used a greedy approach that incrementally builds up a single long portmanteau, extending it via a bridge when necessary. Murphy first built a pool of smaller portmanteaux, then joined them all together. I'm reminded of the [Traveling Salesperson Problem](TSP.ipynb) where one algorithm is to form a single path, always progressing to the nearest neighbor, and another algorithm is to maintain a pool of shorter segments and repeatedly join together the two closest segments. The two approaches are different, but it is not clear whether one is better than the other. You could try it!\n",
    "\n",
    "(*English trivia:*  my program builds a single path of words, and when the path gets stuck and I need something to allow me to continue, it makes sense to call that thing a **bridge**.  Murphy's program starts by building a large pool of small portmanteaux that he calls **particles**, and when he can build no more particles, his next step is to put two particles together, so he calls it a **join**. The different metaphors for what our programs are doing lead to different terminology for the same idea.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of implementation, mine is in Python and is concise (139 lines); Murphy's is in C++ and is verbose (1867 lines), although Murphy's code does a lot of extra work that mine doesn't: generating diagrams and animations, and running multiple threads in parallel to implement the random restart idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "It appears Murphy didn't quite have the complete concept of **subwords**. He did mention that when he adds `'bulleting'`, he crosses `'bullet'` and `'bulletin'` off the list, but somehow  [his string](http://tom7.org/portmantout/murphy2015portmantout.pdf) contains both `'spectacular'` and `'spectaculars'` in two different places. My guess is that when he adds `'spectaculars'` he crosses off `'spectacular'`, but if he happens to add `'spectacular'` first, he will later add `'spectaculars'`. Support for this view is that his output in `bench.txt` says \"I skipped 24319 words that were already substrs\", but I computed that there are 44,320 such subwords; he found about half of them. I think those missing 20,001 words are the main reason why my strings are coming in at around 554,000 letters, about 57,000 letters shorter than Murphy's 611,820 letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Murphy's joins are always between one-letter prefixes and suffixes. I do the same thing for two-word bridges, because having a `W.bridges[A][B]` for every letter `A` and `B` is  the easiest way to prove that the program will terminate. But for one-word bridges, I allow prefixes and suffixes of any length up to a total of 6 for `len(pre) + len(suf)`. I can get away with this because I limited my candidate pool to the 10,000 `shortwords`. It would have been untenable to build all bridges for all 100,000 words, and probably would not have helped shorten $S$ appreciably.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note 2:* I should say that I stole one important trick from Murphy. I started watching his highly-entertaining [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=QVn2PZGZxaI), but then I paused it because I wanted the fun of solving the problem mostly on my own. After I finished the first version of my program, I returned to the video and [paper](http://tom7.org/portmantout/murphy2015portmantout.pdf) and I noticed that I had a problem in my use of bridges. My program originally looked something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "    (overlap, word) = unused_step(...) or one_word_bridge(...) or two_word_bridge(...)\n",
    "    \n",
    "That is, I only considered two-word bridges when there was no one-word bridge, on the theory that one word is shorter than two. But Murphy showed that my theory was wrong: I had `bridges['w']['c'] = 'workaholic'`, a one-word bridge, but he had the two-word bridge  `'war' + 'arc' = 'warc'`, which saves six letters over my single word. After seeing that, I shamelessly copied his approach, and now I too get a four-letter bridge for `'w' + 'c'` (sometimes  `'warc'` and sometimes `'we' + 'etc' = 'wetc'`)."

    "I'll stop here, but you should feel free to do more experimentation of your own. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things you could do to make the portmantouts more interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use linguistic resources (such as [pretrained word embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)) to teach your program what words are related to each other. Encourage the program to place  related words next to each other.\n",
    "- Use linguistic resources (such as [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk/)) to teach your program where syllable breaks are in words, and what each syllable sounds like. Encourage the program to make overlaps match syllables. (That's why \"preferendumdums\" sounds better than \"fortyphonshore\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things you could do to make $S$ shorter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lookahead**: Unused words are chosen based on the degree of overlap, but nothing else. It might help to prefer unused words which have a suffix that matches the prefix of another unused word. A single-word lookahead or a bbeam search could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reserving words**: It seems like `haydn` and `dnieper` are made to go together; they're the only words with `dn` as an affix. If `haydn` was selected first, `unused_step` would select `dnieper` next, but if `dnieper` as selected first, we'd lose the chance to take advantage of that overlap. Maybe there could be a system that assures `haydn` comes first, or a preprocessing step that joined together words that uniquely go together. This is getting close to what Murphy did in his program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word choice ordering**: Perhaps `compute_startswith` could sort the words in each key's bucket so that the \"difficult\" words (say, the ones that end in unusual letters) are encountered earlier in the program's execution, when there are more available words for them to connect to.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Here are some things you could do to make the program more robust:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write and run unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find other word lists and try the program on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider what to do for a wordset that has missing bridges. You could try three-word bridges, you could allow the program to back up and remove a previously-placed word; you could allow the addition of words to the start as well as the end of `P`)."
